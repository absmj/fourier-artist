> Why is the square of "i" a negative number...

In middle school mathematics, we are introduced to the number "i"; But why does this number differ from other numbers...

Starting with a simple question, I once again witnessed how fascinating and versatile mathematics is as a result of the investigation. Especially in the calculations involving coordinates, the application of this number leads to the creation of different representations and intricate fractals in urban settings.

## Fourier Transformations

Here, representations are "redrawn" using Fourier transformations. Fourier transformations are applied to separate information into sinusoidal waves, simplifying and reusing the data. See: [An Interactive Introduction to Fourier Transforms](https://www.jezzamon.com/fourier/index.html)
